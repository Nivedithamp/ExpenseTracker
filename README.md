The Expense Tracker Application is a robust and user-friendly tool designed to simplify expense management. It empowers users to:

- Add, update, and delete expense records.
- Categorize expenses under predefined categories (e.g., Meals, Travel, Software).
- View total expenses by category with clear visualizations.
- Manage user details associated with expenses, including user codes and expense summaries.
- Search and filter expenses or users for quick access to relevant information.
- Paginate through large datasets, ensuring smooth navigation for better usability.
- Handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to users.

Designed with scalability and user experience in mind, the application ensures smooth operation even with large datasets.

üöÄ How to Run the Project

Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system.
- MongoDB database connection string.
- A package manager (npm or xyarn).

Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   PORT=5002
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The backend server will run on [http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002).

Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The frontend server will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (default Vite port).

üìä Design and Implementation Tradeoffs

1. Data Model Simplification
- A straightforward MongoDB schema is used for users and expenses.
- While efficient for current needs, more complex relationships (e.g., multi-level categorization) may require schema redesigns.

2. Pagination
- Pagination is implemented on the client side for simplicity. Server-side pagination may be more efficient for larger datasets.

3. Search Functionality
- Implemented client-side for responsiveness. For larger datasets, this could be optimized to work server-side.

4. Notifications
- React-toastify is used for notifications, improving feedback for user actions.

5. Loading Indicators
- Basic spinners are used during data fetches. This can be enhanced with skeleton loaders for better UX.
